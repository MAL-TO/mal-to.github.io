About us
===
The field of data science is becoming increasingly more important in our everyday life. In particular, at Politecnico di Torino, we strive to become national and international leaders in the field. To this end, this year we are introducing MALTO (MAchine Learning @ poliTO).

We are building a student team with the goal to take part in (and win!) international data science competitions. Many world-famous conferences and companies are proposing - year after year - some of the toughest and most interesting data-driven challenges for the world to solve. We want to join these competitions, tackle new problems and develop innovative solutions. 

Goals and activities
===
The main goal of the team is to take part in various data science competitions (examples of past competitions can be found [here](https://kdd.org/kdd2022/), [here](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022/CompetitionTrack) and [here](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2023/)). These competitions typically consist in achieving high performance on machine learning problems (e.g. classification or regression), proposing novel, cutting-edge approaches. But thereâ€™s more! You will typically have the chance to write a scientific paper to present your solution to the world. After that, you will probably want to publish your code or build an open source library for others to use. Then come the prizes, travels and presentations at conferences around the globe. Then rinse and repeat for the countless other challenges out there!

Who can join
===
MALTO is a student team; as such, all students enrolled at Politecnico di Torino may apply. The nature of the team makes it strongly recommended that applicants have some working knowledge of programming and a background in data science, machine learning or statistics, either acquired during your academic studies, or on your own. Ideally, your background allows you to read and understand relevant scientific writings (e.g. books, papers) and technical documentation (e.g. API and libraries documentation). 

How to apply
===
**Applications are actually open until ~~31/01~~ 15/02/2024!**

You can send your application by filling in the following [Google form](https://forms.gle/p6KXkzZ1jNHCLy138) by the date indicated, we are waiting for you! 

After an initial selection phase, a small test and cognitive interview with team members will take place! But don't worry, this second phase will start *after the end of the winter session*!
