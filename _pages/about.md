Call for Applications
===
The field of data science is becoming increasingly more important in our everyday life. In particular, at Politecnico di Torino, we strive to become national and international leaders in the field. To this end, this year we are introducing MALTO (MAchine Learning @ poliTO).

We are building a student team with the goal to take part in (and win!) international data science competitions. Many world-famous conferences and companies are proposing - year after year - some of the toughest and most interesting data-driven challenges for the world to solve. We want to join these competitions, tackle new problems and develop innovative solutions. 

Goals and activities
===
The main goal of the team is to take part in various data science competitions (examples of past competitions can be found [here](https://kdd.org/kdd2022/), [here](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022/CompetitionTrack) and [here](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2023/)). These competitions typically consist in achieving high performance on machine learning problems (e.g. classification or regression), proposing novel, cutting-edge approaches. But there’s more! You will typically have the chance to write a scientific paper to present your solution to the world. After that, you will probably want to publish your code or build an open source library for others to use. Then come the prizes, travels and presentations at conferences around the globe. Then rinse and repeat for the countless other challenges out there!

Who can join
===
MALTO is a student team; as such, all students enrolled at Politecnico di Torino may apply. The nature of the team makes it strongly recommended that applicants have some working knowledge of programming and a background in data science, machine learning or statistics, either acquired during your academic studies, or on your own. Ideally, your background allows you to read and understand relevant scientific writings (e.g. books, papers) and technical documentation (e.g. API and libraries documentation). 

As the majority of the work will be done in Python, we ask that you are profiecient in Python. Knowledge of the following libraries is a plus: 
* pandas/NumPy/SciPy
* scikit-learn
* TensorFlow/Keras
* PyTorch

How to apply
===
You may submit your MALTO application to [flavio.giobergia@polito.it](flavio.giobergia@polito.it). Please use the subject `[MALTO] Application` and include the following attachments:
* Your curriculum of studies (you can download a self-certification from Portale della Didattica for courses attended at Politecnico di Torino), including Bachelor’s and Master’s courses attended, with grades (when applicable)
* A link to your GitHub account or similar profile

We will process applications in two batches, with deadlines:
* **March 15, 2023**
* **March 31, 2023**

After each deadline, we will proceed with an assessment of all the candidates who applied in time. After a preliminary phase, we will proceed with a technical test to get a better grasp of your understanding of various topics (don't worry, we don't expect you to know *everything*!) and an interview to talk about you and your fit within the team. 

Excited about MALTO yet?
